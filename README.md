üöÄ codepulse
A VS Code extension that tracks your development rhythm and provides real-time feedback on your coding activity.

(You can replace this with a real GIF of your extension in action later!)

## Overview
codepulse brings your coding sessions to life by adding a dynamic status indicator to your VS Code status bar. It intelligently detects your activity‚Äîwhether you're actively typing, pasting a block of code, or just taking a moment to think‚Äîand provides immediate visual feedback. The goal is to make you more aware of your coding patterns and make the development experience more engaging.

This project started as a simple idea in Alappuzha, Kerala, and has grown into a powerful developer utility.

## Features
Real-time Status Tracking: Automatically detects your current state:

Typing: When you're actively writing code.

Pasting: When a large block of text is inserted.

Chilling: When you're inactive or thinking.

Dynamic Status Bar Item: A clean and clear indicator in your status bar that updates instantly with your status, complete with helpful icons.

Gamified Achievements (Coming Soon!): Unlock badges for hitting coding milestones, like working late ("Night Owl") or starting your first session of the day.

## Installation
Navigate to the Extensions view in VS Code (Ctrl+Shift+X).

Search for codepulse.

Click Install.

Reload VS Code and start coding!

(Note: The extension is not yet published. For now, you can run it from source by cloning the repository and pressing F5).

## How to Use
Once installed, codepulse works automatically in the background. Simply look at the bottom-left corner of your VS Code window to see your current status in the status bar. As you type, pause, or paste code, you'll see the status change in real time.

## Future Roadmap
We have many exciting features planned to make codepulse even more powerful:

üìä Activity Dashboard: A detailed report view (WebView) with charts showing time spent per language, project heatmaps, and more.

üçÖ Pomodoro Timer: An integrated focus timer to help you manage your work and break intervals.

üîó External Integrations: Automatically update your Slack/Discord status or log your coding time to services like Toggl.

ü§ñ AI-Powered Summaries: Get a natural language summary of your day's work.
